## Introduction

- I created this project for learn Deep Learning with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/topics/tensorflow) [Keras](https://github.com/topics/keras).

- I'm learning from [BTK Academy](https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/veri-bilimi-icin-python-ve-tensorflow-11705), Udemy and YouTube.

## How To Run

- For run this project you need [python](https://www.python.org) installed on your local machine.

- I'm running jupyter notebook files (ipynb) with Visual Studio Code. Ä±f you want to use Jupyter Notebook you ned to install it from official site https://jupyter.org/install. Follow instructions on [this](https://jupyter.org/install) page for downloading jupyter notebook.

- First of all create a virtual environment for dependency management of project and activate virtual environment.
    - For Example use venv from python

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

    - After created and activated virtual environment run

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- You are ready to run project. Run a file with
    ```shell
    python "filepath"
    ```
    - For example
        ```shell
        python 1_Basics/basics.py
        ```
